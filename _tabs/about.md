Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm passionate about anything computer science-related, covering a variety of topics from mathematics and algorithms to sharing my own editorials/solutions for online judges (e.g. Codeforces). Occasionally, you'll also find random ideas, thoughts, and projects I'm currently working on (if I even make it to at least 20% completion, lol).

This blog is a mix of structured deep dives, problem-solving strategies, and spontaneous reflections. Whether you're here for technical insights or just to explore ideas, I hope you find something interesting.
